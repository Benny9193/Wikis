## Overview

**Fallout 3** is an action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks in 2008. It revived the Fallout franchise after a long hiatus, transitioning the series to 3D first-person gameplay while maintaining the retro-futuristic aesthetic and dark humor.

## Setting

The game is set in 2277, 200 years after the Great War, in the Capital Wasteland—the ruins of Washington D.C. and surrounding areas of Maryland and Virginia.

## Plot

The player is the Lone Wanderer, who grew up in Vault 101. When their father, James, mysteriously leaves the vault, the player must venture into the wasteland to find him and uncover his work on "Project Purity"—a plan to provide clean water to the wasteland.

### Main Quest

1. Escape Vault 101
2. Find your father in the wasteland
3. Help complete Project Purity
4. Deal with the Enclave's interference
5. Activate the purifier

## Gameplay Changes

### First-Person Perspective

The transition from isometric to first-person/third-person 3D gameplay was the most significant change from previous entries.

### V.A.T.S.

The Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System allows players to pause combat and target specific body parts, paying homage to the original games' turn-based system.

### Real-Time Combat

Players can also fight in real-time FPS-style combat, though it's less effective than V.A.T.S.

### Exploration

Open-world exploration with hundreds of locations to discover, many with their own stories and loot.
