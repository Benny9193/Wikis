## Overview

**Fallout 2** is the second game in the Fallout series, developed by Black Isle Studios and published by Interplay Entertainment in 1998. It expanded on the original's gameplay while introducing more humor, pop culture references, and a larger game world.

## Setting

The game is set in 2241, 80 years after the events of Fallout 1. The world has developed further, with new nations and settlements emerging from the wasteland.
