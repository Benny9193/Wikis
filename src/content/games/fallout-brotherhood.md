## Overview

**Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel** is an action role-playing game developed and published by Interplay Entertainment in 2004. It was the last Fallout game published by Interplay before the franchise was sold to Bethesda Softworks. The game departed significantly from traditional Fallout gameplay, adopting a console-focused action style.

## Setting

The game is set in the Carbon and Los areas of Texas, sometime after the events of Fallout 1. It follows initiates of the Brotherhood of Steel chapter operating in the region.

## Plot

The player is an initiate sent to find a missing Brotherhood patrol. The search leads to the town of Carbon, which has been overrun by raiders. The investigation uncovers a larger threat involving super mutants and a new strain of FEV.

### Story Progression

1. Investigate the missing patrol in Carbon
2. Discover the mutant threat
3. Travel to Los (Los Angeles ruins)
4. Confront the super mutant army
5. Defeat the Vault-Tec remnants behind the conspiracy

## Canon Status
