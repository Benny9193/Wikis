## Overview

**Fawkes** is a Super Mutant who retained his intelligence and humanity despite FEV transformation. Found imprisoned in Vault 87, he becomes one of the most powerful companions in Fallout 3 and represents the philosophical side of Super Mutant existence.

## Background

### Pre-Mutation

Fawkes's original identity is uncertain. Terminal entries in Vault 87 reference several candidates, though Fawkes himself has lost most pre-mutation memories. What remains is his love of knowledge and learning.

### Vault 87

Vault 87 was the East Coast source of Super Mutants:
- Vault-Tec experimented with FEV on residents
- Most subjects became standard hostile mutants
- Fawkes was a rare exception
- He retained intelligence and morality

### Imprisonment

Fawkes was kept in an isolation chamber:
- Other mutants feared his difference
- He spent years alone with terminal access
- Read extensively, gaining vast knowledge
- Named himself after Guy Fawkes (historical figure)

## Recruitment

Found during "Finding the Garden of Eden":
- Located in Vault 87's medical wing
- Imprisoned in Isolation Room 05
- Can be freed via terminal or cell override
- Will retrieve the G.E.C.K. from irradiated chamber

### Requirements
- Must have good or neutral karma
- Evil karma characters cannot recruit him
- Must complete Vault 87 section of main quest
- Available after "Finding the Garden of Eden"

## Combat Abilities

### Exceptional Power
Fawkes is arguably the strongest companion in the game:
- Massive health pool
- Regenerating health
- Super Sledge or Gatling Laser default
- Immune to radiation

### Preferred Weapons
- Default: Super Sledge or Gatling Laser
- Excels with heavy weapons
- Nearly unkillable in combat
- Can solo most encounters

## Companion Perk

Fawkes provides no formal perk, but his combat prowess and radiation immunity make him invaluable.

## Personality

Despite his monstrous appearance:
- Deeply philosophical and introspective
- Values knowledge and learning
- Gentle and considerate
- Struggles with his nature
- Believes in redemption

## Karma Requirements

Fawkes only joins good or neutral characters:
- Represents his moral standards
- Evil players cannot recruit him
- Reflects on the player's character
- Unique among companions

## Role in Main Quest

### The G.E.C.K.
Fawkes can retrieve the G.E.C.K.:
- The chamber is lethally irradiated
- His radiation immunity makes it trivial
- Saves the player from a difficult choice
- Natural solution to the puzzle

### Broken Steel Controversy
In the original ending, Fawkes refuses to activate Project Purity (even though he's immune to radiation). Broken Steel revised this and allowed him to enter the chamber.

## Philosophical Discussions

Fawkes engages in thoughtful dialogue about:
- The nature of humanity
- Whether mutants can be "good"
- The ethics of violence
- Purpose and redemption
- His lost memories

## Views on Super Mutants

- Sees most mutants as tragic victims
- Believes intelligence is possible but rare
- Hopes for peaceful coexistence
- Does not hesitate to fight hostile mutants

## Quotes

> "There is no name yet fashioned that is worthy of me."

> "I've read about these. Before the war, they called them... 'trees.'"

> "The centuries I spent in that cell gave me plenty of time to think."

## Gameplay Notes

- Cannot be recruited with evil karma
- One of the best combat companions
- May trivialize game difficulty
- Useful for carrying heavy items
- Only available late in main quest

## Trivia

- Named himself after the historical Guy Fawkes
- Wes Johnson also voices several other characters
- His presence makes endgame combat very easy
- Can be found after the main quest at the Museum of History
- Terminal entries hint at his possible original identity
- His philosophical nature contrasts with other mutants
