## Overview

**Nick Valentine** is a synthetic humanoid (synth) who operates as a private detective in Diamond City. He is one of the most popular companions in Fallout 4, known for his noir-inspired personality and fascinating backstory.

## Background

Nick is a prototype Generation 2.5 synth created by the Institute. Unlike other synths, he possesses the memories and personality of a pre-war detective from Chicago, also named Nick Valentine.

### Pre-War Nick Valentine

The original Nick Valentine was a police detective in Chicago who was engaged to a woman named Jennifer Lands. His memories were preserved by the Institute as an experiment in personality transfer.

### Escape from the Institute

Nick escaped from the Institute under unknown circumstances. His memories of this period are fragmented, and he awoke in a pile of trash with no clear recollection of how he got there.

## Diamond City

Despite initial suspicion due to his synth nature, Nick established himself in Diamond City as a private investigator. His keen detective skills and genuine desire to help people eventually earned him acceptance from most residents.

## The Valentine Detective Agency

Nick runs the Valentine Detective Agency from a small office in Diamond City's market area. He is assisted by his secretary, Ellie Perkins.

## Companion Perk

**Close to Metal** - When Nick is the active companion and at maximum affinity, the player gains one extra guess when hacking terminals and reduces terminal lockout time by 50%.
