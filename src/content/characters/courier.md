## Overview

**The Courier** is the player-controlled protagonist of Fallout: New Vegas. A delivery person working for the Mojave Express, the Courier was ambushed while carrying a mysterious package—a platinum chip—to New Vegas.

## Background

The Courier's backstory is largely left to the player's imagination, though various dialogue options and the Lonesome Road DLC reveal some potential history:

- May have traveled extensively across the wasteland
- Possibly responsible for the destruction of a community called The Divide
- Has a connection to another courier named Ulysses

## The Platinum Chip

The Courier was hired to deliver a platinum chip to Mr. House in New Vegas. This chip is revealed to be a crucial piece of pre-war technology that Mr. House needs to upgrade his Securitron army.

## Benny's Ambush

At Goodsprings Cemetery, the Courier was ambushed by Benny, chairman of the Tops Casino, and his Great Khan accomplices. Benny shot the Courier in the head and buried them in a shallow grave. Against all odds, the Courier survived.

## Recovery

The Courier was rescued by Victor, a Securitron, and brought to Doc Mitchell in Goodsprings. After recovering, the Courier sets out on a journey of revenge and becomes entangled in the conflict for control of the Mojave.

## Impact on the Mojave

The Courier's choices determine the fate of the Mojave Wasteland, including:

- Which faction controls the region
- The fate of New Vegas
- The outcome of the Second Battle of Hoover Dam
- The survival or destruction of various communities
