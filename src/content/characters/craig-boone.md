## Overview

**Craig Boone** is a former NCR First Recon sharpshooter working as a night guard in Novac. He is one of the most combat-effective companions in Fallout: New Vegas, known for his exceptional marksmanship and tragic backstory.

## Background

Boone served with the NCR's elite sniper unit, First Recon, participating in numerous military operations including the Bitter Springs Massacre. His experiences left him with deep psychological scars.

### Bitter Springs

The defining trauma of Boone's life:
- First Recon was ordered to attack a Great Khan encampment
- The camp contained mostly civilians—elderly, women, and children
- Boone followed orders and killed many innocents
- He has never forgiven himself

### Carla Boone

After leaving the military, Boone married Carla and settled in Novac. Carla was pregnant when she was kidnapped by Legion slavers. Rather than let her suffer as a slave, Boone made an impossible choice—he shot her himself from a distance.
