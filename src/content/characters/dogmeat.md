## Overview

**Dogmeat** is the iconic canine companion of the Fallout series. While technically different dogs in each game, the name has become synonymous with the loyal German Shepherd who aids players throughout the wasteland.

## Appearances

### Fallout (1997)

The original Dogmeat is found in Junktown, where he can be recruited by either wearing a leather jacket (reminding him of his previous owner) or by feeding him an iguana-on-a-stick.

### Fallout 2 (1998)

Dogmeat appears as a special encounter, serving as an easter egg and tribute to the original game.

### Fallout 3 (2008)

Dogmeat is found in the Scrapyard, defending himself against raiders. He becomes a permanent companion and can be sent to Vault 101 for safekeeping. Through the Broken Steel DLC, players can obtain puppies if Dogmeat dies.

### Fallout 4 (2015)

Dogmeat is found at Red Rocket truck stop early in the game. Unlike other companions, Dogmeat does not affect affinity with other companions and can be used alongside them with certain perks.

## Abilities

- **Tracking** - Can follow scent trails to locate enemies or objectives
- **Item retrieval** - Finds useful items in the environment
- **Combat** - Attacks and holds enemies, giving players tactical advantage
- **Intimidation** - Some enemies may flee when confronted by Dogmeat

## Attack Dog Perk (Fallout 4)

The Attack Dog perk enhances Dogmeat's combat abilities:

- **Rank 1** - Dogmeat can grab and hold enemies
- **Rank 2** - Dogmeat inflicts increased damage
- **Rank 3** - Dogmeat can cripple enemy limbs

## Cultural Impact

Dogmeat has become one of gaming's most beloved animal companions, representing loyalty and friendship in the harsh wasteland. The character was inspired by the dog "Blood" from the 1975 film "A Boy and His Dog."

## Notable Traits

- Cannot be killed in Fallout 4 (essential NPC)
- Does not judge the player's actions
- Can wear dog armor and accessories
- Responds to Sole Survivor's whistle command
