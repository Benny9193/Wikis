## Overview

**Yes Man** is a modified Securitron with a unique personality subroutine that compels him to be helpful and agreeable to everyone. He serves as the key to the Independent New Vegas ending in Fallout: New Vegas.

## Background

Yes Man was originally a standard Securitron in Mr. House's army. He was captured and reprogrammed by Benny with the help of Emily Ortal, a Followers of the Apocalypse scientist. The reprogramming made him incapable of refusing requests or withholding information.

## Programming Quirk

Due to his modified programming, Yes Man must:
- Answer any question asked of him truthfully
- Agree to help anyone who asks
- Remain perpetually cheerful and optimistic

This makes him both incredibly useful and a potential security risk, as he will help whoever speaks to him.

## Role in the Main Quest

### Benny's Plan

Benny used Yes Man to develop a plan to assassinate Mr. House and take control of New Vegas. This involved stealing the Platinum Chip and using it to upgrade the Securitron army at The Fort.

### The Courier's Option

After dealing with Benny, the Courier can use Yes Man to pursue an independent path:

1. Upgrade the Securitrons at The Fort
2. Deal with or ignore the various factions
3. Activate the Securitron army at Hoover Dam
4. Establish an independent New Vegas

## Location

Yes Man can be found in Benny's suite at The Tops casino after the player confronts Benny. He remains there throughout the game unless moved during the endgame sequence.

## Personality

Despite being forced to be agreeable, Yes Man displays:
- Genuine enthusiasm about plans
- Subtle sarcasm when discussing bad ideas
- Loyalty to whoever is currently using him
- Optimism about any outcome

## Ending

In the independent ending, Yes Man uploads himself to the Lucky 38's mainframe and announces he will make himself "more assertive" - the implications of which are left ambiguous.

## Quotes

> "Hi there! I'm Yes Man! I'm a Securitron, but I'm not like the other Securitrons!"

> "That's a great idea! Or a terrible one. I'm not really in a position to judge."
