## Overview

**The Great War** refers to the global nuclear exchange that occurred on October 23, 2077. In approximately two hours, the major powers of the world—primarily the United States and China—launched their nuclear arsenals, destroying civilization as it was known and creating the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the Fallout series.

## Background

### Resource Wars

The Great War was the culmination of decades of conflict over dwindling natural resources. By the mid-21st century:

- Petroleum reserves were nearly exhausted
- The European Commonwealth dissolved after fighting over the Middle East
- The United Nations collapsed in 2052
- China invaded Alaska in 2066 to secure oil reserves

### The Sino-American War

The conflict between the United States and China escalated throughout the 2070s:

- China occupied Alaska's oil fields
- The U.S. developed and deployed Power Armor
- American forces liberated Alaska in January 2077
- U.S. forces invaded mainland China

## The Day the Bombs Fell

On October 23, 2077, at approximately 9:47 AM Eastern Time, nuclear warheads began striking American soil. Who fired first remains unclear, but both sides launched their full arsenals.

### Timeline

- **9:42 AM** - IONDS (Integrated Operational Nuclear Detection System) detects first launches
- **9:47 AM** - First confirmed nuclear detonation on American soil
- **9:47 AM - 11:00 AM** - Full nuclear exchange
- **By noon** - The war was effectively over

### Casualties

- Billions died in the initial exchange
- Many more perished in the following months from radiation, starvation, and disease
- Most major cities worldwide were destroyed

## Aftermath

### Immediate Effects

- Nuclear winter conditions
- Massive radiation contamination
- Collapse of all government and infrastructure
- EMP destruction of most electronics

### Long-Term Consequences

- Mutation of flora and fauna
- Formation of the wasteland environment
- Rise of vault dwellers and other survivor communities
- Development of new societies, factions, and cultures

## Vaults

Vault-Tec Corporation had constructed 122 Vaults across America, ostensibly to protect citizens from nuclear war. In reality, most Vaults were social experiments. Only a small percentage of the population was saved by the Vaults.

## Legacy

The Great War fundamentally shaped the world of Fallout:

- Technology remained stuck at 1950s aesthetic despite advanced development
- Pre-war remnants became invaluable resources
- The conflict between the old world and new defines wasteland politics
- The threat of repeating history looms over all survivors
