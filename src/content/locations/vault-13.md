## Overview

**Vault 13** is a Vault-Tec vault located in Southern California, serving as the starting location for the original Fallout. It is one of the most significant locations in the Fallout universe, being the home of the legendary Vault Dweller.

## The Vault Experiment

Vault 13 was designed to remain closed for 200 years, far longer than other vaults. The experiment was to study the effects of prolonged isolation on a vault community. The population would be observed to see how they adapted to extended confinement with no contact with the outside world.

## The Water Chip Crisis

### The Problem

In December 2161, Vault 13's water purification chip malfunctioned. Without a replacement, the vault's water recycling system would fail within 150 days, dooming the inhabitants to death by dehydration.

### The Vault Dweller's Quest

The Overseer selected a young vault resident—the Vault Dweller—to venture into the unknown wasteland and find a replacement water chip. This quest would ultimately lead to the discovery of the super mutant threat and the Master's plans.

### Resolution

The Vault Dweller successfully retrieved a water chip from Vault 12 in Necropolis, saving Vault 13. However, this was only the beginning of a larger adventure that would reshape the wasteland.

## Notable Residents

### Fallout 1 Era
- **The Vault Dweller** - The protagonist who saved the vault
- **Jacoren** - The Overseer who sent the Vault Dweller on their quest
- **Theresa** - A concerned citizen

## History

### Pre-War
Vault 13 was constructed in a cave system in the mountains of Southern California. It was designed to house 1,000 residents and remain sealed for two centuries.

### The Great War
When the bombs fell, Vault 13 sealed its doors with its full complement of residents. The vault successfully protected its inhabitants from the nuclear holocaust.

### Post-War Isolation
For 84 years, Vault 13 remained sealed. The residents developed their own society, largely ignorant of the wasteland developing outside.

### Opening (2161)
The water chip crisis forced Vault 13 to open its doors for the first time. The Vault Dweller's departure marked a turning point in the vault's history.

### The Vault Dweller's Exile
After saving both the vault and the wasteland from the Master's army, the Vault Dweller was exiled by Overseer Jacoren. The Overseer feared that the Vault Dweller's experiences had changed them too much to reintegrate into vault society.

### Enclave Attack (2242)
By the time of Fallout 2, Vault 13 had been attacked by the Enclave, who captured most of the human inhabitants for their FEV experiments. The vault was later inhabited by intelligent deathclaws led by Gruthar.
