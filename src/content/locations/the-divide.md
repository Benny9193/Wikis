## Overview

**The Divide** is a devastated canyon region that serves as the setting for the Fallout: New Vegas DLC "Lonesome Road." Once a thriving community built around a vital trade route, the Divide was destroyed by nuclear detonations triggered accidentally by the Courier, becoming one of the most dangerous locations in the wasteland.

## History

### The Community

Before its destruction, the Divide was home to a growing community:
- Built along a vital supply route
- Connected the NCR to the Mojave
- Served by couriers carrying packages
- Developed its own culture and identity

### The Courier's Role

The Courier, before the events of New Vegas, unknowingly delivered a package containing detonation codes. When activated, these codes triggered dormant nuclear warheads buried beneath the Divide.

### The Destruction

The detonations:
- Tore the land apart
- Created the canyon landscape
- Killed most inhabitants
- Irradiated the entire region
- Spawned the Marked Men

### Ulysses

One survivor witnessed the destruction: Ulysses, another courier who had followed the community's growth. He became obsessed with the Courier's role in the destruction and sought revenge.

## The Environment

The Divide is wracked by perpetual:
