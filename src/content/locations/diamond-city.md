## Overview

**Diamond City** is the largest and most prosperous settlement in the Commonwealth, built within the ruins of Fenway Park in Boston. Known as "The Great Green Jewel," it serves as a major trading hub and relatively safe haven in the dangerous wasteland.

## History

After the Great War, survivors gradually settled in the ruins of Fenway Park, drawn by its defensible walls. Over time, the settlement grew into a thriving community. The city has faced various challenges, including a period of organized crime under the "mayor" before the current administration.

## Layout

### The Market

The central area of Diamond City, located on the former baseball field. Features numerous vendors, including:

- **Arturo's** - Weapons dealer
- **Myrna's** - General goods (paranoid about synths)
- **Takahashi's** - Noodle stand (Power Noodles)
- **Solomon's** - Chem dealer
- **Chem-I-Care** - Medical supplies

### The Upper Stands

The wealthier residents live in the upper stands, including Mayor McDonough's office and the more affluent homes.

### The Wall

The outer stands serve as the city's primary defense, manned by Diamond City security.

## Notable Locations

- **Valentine Detective Agency** - Nick Valentine's office
- **Publick Occurrences** - Piper's newspaper office
- **The Dugout Inn** - Local bar run by the Bobrov brothers
- **Science! Center** - Doctor Sun's medical practice
- **Schoolhouse** - Education for the city's children

## Government

Diamond City is led by Mayor McDonough, who rose to power on an anti-synth platform. The city maintains its own security force armed with baseball equipment-themed weapons and armor.

## The Synth Question

Diamond City has a complex relationship with synths. Mayor McDonough's election was partly based on anti-synth sentiment, and paranoia about hidden synths runs deep among residents.

## Notable Residents

- **Mayor McDonough** - Controversial political leader
- **Piper Wright** - Journalist and potential companion
- **Nick Valentine** - Synth detective
- **Moe Cronin** - Baseball memorabilia enthusiast
