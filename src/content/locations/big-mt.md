## Overview

**Big MT** (Big Mountain, colloquially "Big Empty") is a massive pre-war research crater in the Mojave, serving as the setting for the Fallout: New Vegas DLC "Old World Blues." Once a cutting-edge scientific facility, it now stands as a monument to pre-war hubris and scientific ethics violations.

## History

### Pre-War Operations

Big MT was the United States' premier scientific research facility:
- Unlimited government funding
- No ethical oversight
- Best scientists in the nation
- Complete secrecy

### The Great War

When the bombs fell, Big MT was largely spared due to its remote location and underground facilities. The scientists continued their work, cut off from the outside world.

### Post-War Isolation

Over two centuries, the Think Tank scientists:
- Preserved themselves as brains in jars
- Lost most of their memories and sanity
- Continued experiments without purpose
- Created the horrors that roam the facility

## The Think Tank

The facility is now controlled by the Think Tank—five scientists who uploaded their brains into robotic life support systems:

### Dr. Klein
- Nominal leader
- Obsessed with penises ("the formless penises!")
- Hostile to outsiders
- Paranoid about Mobius

### Dr. Borous
- Created most of Big MT's creatures
- Obsessed with his high school tormentors
- Made cyberdogs and cazadors
- Extremely unstable

### Dr. Dala
- Fascinated by human bodies ("teddy bears")
- Studies physical forms
- Deeply strange desires
- Most interested in the Courier

### Dr. 0 (Zero)
- Robotics specialist
- Constant rival of Dr. 8
- Created Securitrons (pre-House)
- Spelled his name poorly

### Dr. 8
- Communications expert
- Speaks only in static
- Actually quite reasonable
- Helps with translation

### Dr. Mobius
- Former Think Tank member
- Self-exiled to the Forbidden Zone
- Appears to be the villain
- Actually trying to contain the Think Tank

## Creations of Big MT

The facility spawned numerous wasteland horrors:

### Cazadors
- Giant mutant wasps
- Created by Dr. Borous
- Escaped into the Mojave
- Became a major threat

### Night Stalkers
- Coyote-rattlesnake hybrids
- Escaped experiments
- Roam the Mojave

### Lobotomites
- Humans with brain replacements
- Mindless and aggressive
- Roam the crater

### Roboscorpions
- Dr. Mobius's creations
- Guard the Forbidden Zone
- Shoot electricity

## The Courier's Ordeal

The Courier is abducted and has:
- **Brain removed** - Replaced with Tesla coils
- **Heart removed** - Replaced with artificial pump
- **Spine removed** - Replaced with servos

These can be recovered or left as upgrades, with different benefits and conversations.

## Themes

### Scientific Ethics
Old World Blues critiques science without morality:
- Experiments without consent
- Knowledge pursued regardless of consequences
- Scientists losing sight of humanity
- The dangers of unchecked research

### Humor and Horror
The DLC balances:
- Ridiculous dialogue from the Think Tank
- Genuine horror of lobotomites
- Absurd science-fiction concepts
- Real consequences of pre-war actions

### The Old World's Legacy
Big MT created many wasteland threats:
- Deathclaws (enhanced here)
- Cazadors (created here)
- Night Stalkers (created here)
- The Cloud (developed here)

## Connections to Other DLC

Big MT connects to all New Vegas DLC:
- **Dead Money** - The Cloud was developed here
- **Honest Hearts** - Research into tribal cultures
- **Lonesome Road** - Ulysses's recordings found here
- **Base Game** - Explains origins of wasteland threats

## Legacy

Big MT represents the dangers of:
- Science without ethics
- Knowledge without wisdom
- Isolation from consequences
- The pre-war mentality that destroyed the world
