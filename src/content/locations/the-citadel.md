## Overview

**The Citadel** is the heavily fortified headquarters of the East Coast Brotherhood of Steel, built within the ruins of the Pentagon. It serves as the central hub for Brotherhood operations in the Capital Wasteland and represents the most significant military installation in the region.

## History

### The Pentagon

Before the Great War, the Pentagon was the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense. The massive five-sided building was one of the largest office buildings in the world, housing the nation's military command structure.

### Post-War Occupation

When the Brotherhood of Steel expanded to the East Coast under Elder Lyons, they discovered the Pentagon ruins and recognized their strategic value. The Brotherhood fortified the remaining structure and established it as their base of operations.

### Renaming

The Brotherhood named their fortress "The Citadel," reflecting its role as an impregnable stronghold and the heart of their chapter.

## Liberty Prime

The Citadel houses the Brotherhood's most ambitious project: reactivating Liberty Prime.

### What is Liberty Prime?

Liberty Prime was a massive pre-war military robot designed to turn the tide of the Sino-American War. It stood approximately 40 feet tall and was armed with devastating weapons including:
- Eye-mounted laser beams
- Mini-nuclear bombs
- Extreme physical strength

### Reconstruction

Under Scribe Rothchild's direction, the Brotherhood spent years attempting to restore Liberty Prime to operational status. The main obstacle was power—the robot required massive amounts of energy to function.

### Activation

With components recovered during the main quest, the Brotherhood finally activates Liberty Prime for the assault on Project Purity.

## Role in Main Quest

The Citadel becomes central to the main story:

### The Waters of Life
After the Enclave attacks Project Purity, Dr. Li leads survivors to the Citadel for refuge. This establishes the alliance between the scientists and the Brotherhood.

### Finding the G.E.C.K.
The Brotherhood provides resources and intelligence to help locate a Garden of Eden Creation Kit.

### Take it Back!
Liberty Prime leads the Brotherhood assault on the Enclave-occupied Jefferson Memorial, clearing the path to Project Purity.

## Military Strength

The Citadel represents significant military power:
- **Power Armor** - Full suits for all combat personnel
- **Energy Weapons** - Advanced laser and plasma armaments
- **Vertibirds** - Captured aircraft
- **Training** - Rigorous combat preparation
- **Liberty Prime** - Ultimate weapon

## Lyons' Brotherhood

Elder Lyons reformed the East Coast Brotherhood with a focus on:
- Protecting wasteland inhabitants
- Fighting super mutants
- Providing humanitarian aid

This differs from the Western Brotherhood's focus on technology preservation, causing friction with Brotherhood traditionalists.

## The Outcasts

Disagreement over Lyons' policies led to a splinter group, the Brotherhood Outcasts, who left the Citadel to pursue traditional Brotherhood objectives. They remain hostile to Lyons' Brotherhood.

## Defenses

The Citadel maintains formidable defenses:
- **Pentagon walls** - Original structure provides protection
- **Power armor troops** - Heavily armed patrols
- **Fixed weapons** - Defensive emplacements
- **Strategic location** - Difficult approach across ruins
