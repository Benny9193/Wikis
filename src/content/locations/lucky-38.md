## Overview

The **Lucky 38** is a pre-war casino and hotel towering over the New Vegas Strip. Sealed for over 200 years, it serves as the headquarters and personal residence of Mr. House, the enigmatic ruler of New Vegas.

## Pre-War History

The Lucky 38 was constructed before the Great War as a luxury casino and hotel. Its distinctive tower dominated the Las Vegas skyline, featuring:
- World-class casino floor
- Luxury hotel suites
- High-end restaurants
- Private penthouse for the owner

## Mr. House's Domain

Robert Edwin House, the pre-war technology mogul and CEO of RobCo Industries, used his vast wealth and predictive algorithms to prepare for the nuclear war. He installed himself in the Lucky 38's penthouse, connected to a life support system that has kept him alive for over 200 years.

### The Sealed Tower

After the Great War, the Lucky 38 remained sealed. No one entered or left for over two centuries. This gave rise to countless rumors about what—or who—was inside. Many assumed it was simply an empty shell, while others whispered about the ghost who watched New Vegas from above.

### Securitron Army

From his isolation, Mr. House controlled his army of Securitron robots through a vast computer network. These robots patrol the Strip and enforce Mr. House's will throughout New Vegas.

## The Courier's Access

The Courier is the first outsider permitted inside the Lucky 38 in over 200 years. Victor, Mr. House's Securitron, delivers the invitation after the Courier reaches the Strip.

### Why the Courier?

Mr. House takes interest in the Courier for several reasons:
- The Courier's proven survival ability
- Potential as an agent to retrieve the platinum chip
- Mr. House's larger plans for the Mojave

## Layout

### Casino Floor
- Defunct gambling tables and slot machines
- Main entrance atrium
- Bar area
- Securitron guards

### Hotel Suites
- Multiple floors of abandoned luxury rooms
- Potential player housing
- Storage facilities

### Cocktail Lounge
- Upper floor lounge area
- Pre-war ambiance preserved
- Views of the Strip

### Penthouse
- Mr. House's private domain
- Control center for Securitron network
- The hidden chamber containing Mr. House's body

### Basement
- Maintenance areas
- Power systems
- Hidden vault access

## Mr. House's Life Support

Mr. House's biological body is contained within a sealed chamber connected to the Lucky 38's computer systems. He interfaces with the outside world through:
- A giant screen displaying his pre-war likeness
- His Securitron army
- Advanced surveillance systems
- The Courier, as his chosen agent

### The Real Mr. House

If the player opens Mr. House's chamber, they discover a withered, ancient figure barely clinging to life. Exposure to the outside environment rapidly accelerates his deterioration.

## Quests

### The House Always Wins
Mr. House's multi-part questline where the Courier serves as his agent, working to secure his vision for New Vegas.

### Wild Card
Yes Man, an AI subordinate to Mr. House, offers an alternative path to taking control of the Lucky 38 and Vegas for the Courier themselves.

## Player Housing

After gaining access, the Courier can use the Lucky 38 as a base of operations:
- **Presidential Suite** - Personal quarters
- **Companion Suite** - Housing for companions
- **Storage** - Safe containers for equipment
- **Workbenches** - Crafting stations

## Strategic Value

The Lucky 38 represents significant power:
- Command center for Securitron army
- Surveillance over all of New Vegas
- Symbol of authority on the Strip
- Advanced pre-war technology

## The Platinum Chip

The Lucky 38 contains systems that can only be activated with the platinum chip—the same chip the Courier was shot over. This chip:
- Upgrades Mr. House's Securitrons
- Accesses the hidden bunker at Hoover Dam
- Represents the key to Mr. House's ultimate plans

## Possible Fates

### Mr. House Victory
House's plans succeed, and he continues ruling from the Lucky 38 indefinitely.

### Independent Vegas
The Courier takes control of the Lucky 38, ruling New Vegas through Yes Man.

### House's Death
If the Courier sides with the NCR or Legion (or simply kills House), the Lucky 38's role diminishes, though the Courier may still use it as a residence.

## Symbol of New Vegas

The Lucky 38 embodies New Vegas itself:
- Pre-war glamour preserved through the apocalypse
- Controlled by forces most don't understand
- A beacon visible across the Mojave
- Full of secrets behind its sealed doors
