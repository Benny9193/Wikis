## Overview

**Vault 111** is a Vault-Tec vault located in Sanctuary Hills, Massachusetts, serving as the starting location for Fallout 4. Unlike most vaults, Vault 111 was designed for cryogenic preservation of its residents, keeping them in suspended animation.

## The Vault Experiment

Vault 111's experiment focused on the effects of long-term cryogenic suspension on unsuspecting human subjects. Residents were told the cryogenic pods were for "decontamination" but were actually frozen indefinitely for observation.

### Deception

Vault-Tec staff were aware of the true nature of the experiment, while the residents believed they were entering standard decontamination pods. This deception was maintained until the moment of freezing.

### Observation Protocol

The vault was staffed by Vault-Tec scientists who were supposed to monitor the frozen subjects. However, circumstances after the Great War led to the breakdown of this oversight.

## Timeline

### October 23, 2077 - The Great War
The Sole Survivor, their spouse, and infant son Shaun entered Vault 111 moments before the nuclear detonation. They were immediately frozen in cryogenic pods.

### Staff Crisis
The vault's staff eventually ran out of supplies and attempted to leave. When denied permission by Vault-Tec, they mutinied. The resulting conflict left no survivors among the staff.

### 2227 - The Kidnapping
The Institute, seeking uncorrupted pre-war DNA, sent Kellogg to retrieve an infant. Shaun was taken, and the Sole Survivor's spouse was murdered when they resisted. The Sole Survivor witnessed this but was refrozen.

### 2287 - Awakening
A system malfunction finally released the Sole Survivor from cryogenic suspension, 210 years after the Great War. They emerged into a world completely transformed.

## Notable Individuals

- **The Sole Survivor** - The protagonist, frozen for 210 years
- **Nate/Nora** - The Sole Survivor's spouse, murdered by Kellogg
- **Shaun** - The Sole Survivor's son, kidnapped as an infant
- **Vault-Tec Rep** - Secured the family's vault spot; later found as a ghoul

## Layout

### Surface
- Vault entrance building
- Elevator shaft to vault proper

### Vault Level
- **Cryogenic Bay** - Main chamber with cryogenic pods
- **Overseer's Office** - Administrative center
- **Reactor Room** - Power generation
- **Residential Area** - Living quarters for staff
- **Cafeteria** - Dining area for personnel

## Cryogenic Pods

The vault contains numerous cryogenic pods, each designed to keep a single occupant in suspended animation indefinitely. Most pods malfunctioned over the centuries, killing their occupants. The Sole Survivor's pod was one of the few that maintained function.

### Pod Residents
Most of the original vault residents died in their pods due to:
- Life support failures
- Power fluctuations
- Deliberate termination after the kidnapping

## The Institute Connection

Vault 111 was discovered by the Institute, who recognized the value of preserved pre-war genetic material. Shaun was chosen specifically because he represented "pure" pre-war DNA, uncorrupted by radiation or FEV.

### Father
The kidnapped infant Shaun grew up to become "Father," the leader of the Institute. By the time the Sole Survivor awakens, Shaun is an elderly man, having lived an entire life while his parent remained frozen.

## Legacy

Vault 111 represents one of the most tragic vault experiments:
- Residents were frozen without their true consent
- Most died without ever waking
- The one survivor lost everything—spouse, child, and entire world
- The vault's existence enabled the Institute's plans

## Post-Game

After escaping, the Sole Survivor can return to Vault 111 at any time. The vault serves as a somber reminder of what was lost and the beginning of the journey to find Shaun.
