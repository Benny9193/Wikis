## Overview

**Vault 111** is a Vault-Tec vault located in Sanctuary Hills, Massachusetts. It serves as the starting location for Fallout 4 and is where the Sole Survivor begins their journey into the post-apocalyptic Commonwealth.

## Vault Experiment

Unlike most Vault-Tec vaults, Vault 111 had a relatively straightforward purpose: testing the effects of long-term cryogenic suspension on human subjects. The residents believed they were being temporarily preserved until surface conditions improved.

### The Reality

- Residents were frozen indefinitely without consent
- Only the Overseer and security staff were meant to remain unfrozen
- The experiment was to study the effects of extended cryosleep

## Pre-War Events

On October 23, 2077, as nuclear bombs began falling, the residents of Sanctuary Hills fled to Vault 111. The protagonist, their spouse, and infant son Shaun were among those admitted.

Upon entering, residents were directed to "decontamination pods" which were actually cryogenic chambers. They were frozen immediately.

## Post-War Events

### The Kidnapping

In 2227, the Institute, led by Father (the adult Shaun), opened Vault 111 to retrieve Shaun as an infant. The Sole Survivor's spouse was killed during this raid when they refused to release the baby.

### Awakening

In 2287, a malfunction caused the Sole Survivor's pod to thaw, making them the sole survivor of Vault 111 (hence the name). All other residents had died when life support failed years earlier.
