## Overview

The **Sierra Madre** is a legendary pre-war casino resort, hidden in a remote canyon and shrouded in a deadly toxic Cloud. It serves as the main location for the Fallout: New Vegas DLC "Dead Money," representing one of the most challenging and atmospheric experiences in the game.

## The Legend

Throughout the Mojave, wastelanders tell stories of the Sierra Madre—a paradise untouched by the Great War, filled with unimaginable treasure. The legend promises:
- A casino vault containing vast wealth
- Pre-war technology and luxury
- The chance to "begin again"

What the legends don't mention is the nightmare awaiting those who seek it.

## History

### Pre-War Construction

The Sierra Madre was conceived by Frederick Sinclair as the ultimate luxury resort. Sinclair spared no expense, incorporating cutting-edge technology:
- Self-sustaining systems
- Advanced holographic projectors
- Automated security
- The Cloud—initially a construction tool

### Vera Keyes

Sinclair built the Sierra Madre for Vera Keyes, a famous singer and his beloved. Unknown to Sinclair, Vera was involved with Dean Domino, an entertainer with plans to rob the casino's vault.

### The Gala Event

The Sierra Madre was set to open on October 23, 2077—the day the bombs fell. The grand opening was interrupted by the Great War, sealing the casino and its guests in what would become their tomb.

## The Cloud

The Sierra Madre is engulfed in a corrosive toxic Cloud:
- **Visibility** - Reduces sight to mere feet
- **Damage** - Corrodes flesh and equipment
- **Origin** - Created by malfunctioning construction systems
- **Permanence** - Has not dissipated in 200 years

### Survival

Moving through the Cloud requires:
- Careful route planning
- Locating air pockets
- Finding protective equipment
- Constant vigilance

## The Ghost People

The Sierra Madre is haunted by Ghost People—workers and guests transformed by the Cloud and hazmat suits into something no longer human:
- **Immortality** - Cannot be permanently killed unless dismembered
- **Hostility** - Attack all intruders
- **Mystery** - Their true nature remains unclear
- **Silence** - Communicate only through gestures

## Father Elijah

The Brotherhood of Steel Elder who went rogue after Helios One. Elijah became obsessed with the Sierra Madre's technology, seeing it as the key to reshaping the wasteland. He lures victims to the casino through a radio broadcast, fitting them with explosive collars.

### The Heist

Elijah assembles a team of unwilling participants to break into the casino vault:
- **The Courier** - Essential to the plan
- **Dog/God** - A super mutant with split personalities
- **Dean Domino** - The original conspirator, now a ghoul
- **Christine Royce** - A Brotherhood assassin hunting Elijah

## Key Locations

### The Villa
- Residential area outside the casino
- Ghost People territory
- Workshop facilities
- Connections to companion locations

### The Casino
- Main gambling floor
- Hotel areas
- Theater (with holographic performances)
- Restaurant and bar

### The Vault
- Ultimate destination
- Contains Sinclair's final message
- Gold bars (temptingly heavy)
- The confrontation with Elijah

## Themes

### Letting Go

"Dead Money" explores the theme of letting go—of treasure, of obsession, of the past. Every character is trapped by something they can't release:
- **Elijah** - Obsession with technology
- **Dean** - Jealousy and greed
- **Dog/God** - Internal conflict
- **Christine** - Revenge

### The Trap

The casino itself is a trap. The legendary treasure exists, but taking it comes at impossible costs. The ending forces players to consider: is any treasure worth your life?

## Unique Mechanics

### Explosive Collars
All participants wear explosive collars that detonate if:
- They stray too far from their team
- They get near shielded radios
- Elijah triggers them

### Limited Resources
- No access to outside inventory
- Scrounging for basic supplies
- No fast travel
- Constant threat of death

### Holograms
Deadly holographic security cannot be killed—only avoided or disabled at their emitters.

## Treasure

The Sierra Madre vault contains:
- 37 gold bars (worth 389,943 caps)
- Pre-war technology
- Medical supplies
- Weapon modifications

### The Catch

Each gold bar weighs 35 pounds. Carrying all 37 makes escape virtually impossible—forcing players to choose between wealth and survival.

## Legacy

The Sierra Madre represents:
- The dangers of obsession
- The emptiness of material wealth
- The past's grip on the present
- The importance of letting go
