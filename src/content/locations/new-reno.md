## Overview

**New Reno** is a major city in post-apocalyptic Northern California, appearing in Fallout 2. Unlike other settlements that focus on survival or rebuilding, New Reno embraces vice—it's a city of gambling, prostitution, drug trade, and organized crime, controlled by four warring families.

## History

### Pre-War

Reno was a gambling and entertainment city in Nevada, though smaller and seedier than its neighbor Las Vegas. When the bombs fell, the city survived relatively intact due to its distance from major targets.

### Post-War Development

Rather than rebuild as a conventional settlement, New Reno's survivors embraced the city's pre-war identity. Crime families rose to power, dividing the city among themselves and establishing a brutal but stable order.

New Reno is controlled by four crime families, each with distinct territories and specialties:
