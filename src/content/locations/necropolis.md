## Overview

**Necropolis** (formerly Bakersfield) is a ruined city in Southern California inhabited almost exclusively by ghouls. It plays a crucial role in the original Fallout as the location of the water chip needed to save Vault 13.

## History

### Pre-War Bakersfield

Before the Great War, Bakersfield was a typical California city. Vault 12 was constructed beneath it, designed to house local residents in the event of nuclear war.

### The Vault 12 Experiment

Vault 12's door was designed to not seal properly:
- The experiment studied radiation exposure effects
- Residents were exposed to radiation from day one
- The vault failed its stated purpose
- Residents transformed into ghouls

### Transformation

Over decades, the surviving residents:
- Became ghouls due to radiation
- Emerged to find the city ruined
- Rebuilt among the ruins
- Established a ghoul society
- Named their home "Necropolis" (City of the Dead)

## Factions

### Set's Ghouls

The majority population led by Set:
- Occupy the surface ruins
- Territorial and suspicious
- Hostile to outsiders initially
- Pragmatic survivors

### The Glowing Ones

Highly irradiated ghouls in the Vault:
- Emit harmful radiation
- More feral than surface ghouls
- Guard the water chip
- Dangerous enemies

### The Underground

Hidden peaceful ghouls:
- Live beneath the city
- Led by wise ghouls
- More welcoming than Set's group
- Maintain Vault 12 systems

## Key Locations

### Hall of the Dead
- Set's headquarters
- Surface government center
- Meeting location
- Ghoul guards

### Watershed
- Water purification facility
- Essential to city survival
- Contains the pump
- Strategic location

### Vault 12
- Beneath the city
- Contains the water chip
- Glowing Ones territory
- Heavily irradiated

### The Sewers
- Underground passages
- Connect city sections
- Super mutant access point
- Alternative routes

## The Water Chip Quest

Necropolis is where the Vault Dweller's primary quest can be completed:

### Finding the Chip
- The water chip is in Vault 12
- Must navigate ghoul politics or fight
- Glowing Ones guard it
- Multiple approaches possible

### Fixing the Pump
- Necropolis's water pump is broken
- Can be repaired with a part
- Helps the ghoul population
- Affects city's fate

## Super Mutant Threat

The Master's army has interest in Necropolis:
- Super mutants scout the city
- Seek ghoul subjects for experiments
- Plan to attack if threatened
- Time-based invasion

### The Invasion

If too much time passes:
- Super mutants attack Necropolis
- Most ghouls are slaughtered
- Set and others die
- City becomes truly dead

This creates urgency for players to complete the water chip quest quickly.

## Characters

### Set
- Leader of surface ghouls
- Pragmatic and ruthless
- Suspicious of outsiders
- Deals can be made

### Garret
- Friendly ghoul in underground
- Provides information
- Helps with navigation
- More welcoming than Set

### The Glowing Ones
- Named ghouls guard the vault
- Hostile to all
- High radiation damage
- Must be fought or avoided

## Ghoul Society

Necropolis showcases ghoul culture:
- Organized government under Set
- Functional infrastructure
- Trade capabilities
- Survival against odds
- Distrust of smoothskins

## Themes

### Survival Adaptation
- Ghouls built a society from nothing
- Radiation made them outcasts
- They persevered regardless
- Different doesn't mean lesser

### Tragedy
- Vault-Tec betrayed them
- The world fears them
- Super mutants hunt them
- Their city may fall

### Time Pressure
- The invasion mechanic creates urgency
- Delay means death for innocents
- Choices have consequences
- The clock is ticking

## Legacy

Necropolis establishes:
- Ghoul society and culture
- The tragedy of vault experiments
- Time limits on quests
- Moral complexity in dealings

The fate of Necropolis depends entirely on player choices and timing, making it one of the most significant consequence-driven locations in Fallout 1.
