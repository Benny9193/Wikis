## Overview

**Rivet City** is the largest and most technologically advanced settlement in the Capital Wasteland, built within the beached remains of the aircraft carrier USS Rivet City. It represents the pinnacle of post-war civilization in the region.

## History

### The Aircraft Carrier

The USS Rivet City was a pre-war Nimitz-class aircraft carrier that became stranded in the Potomac River, likely during the chaos of the Great War. Over time, survivors discovered the vessel and began converting it into a permanent settlement.

### Foundation

The settlement was established decades before the events of Fallout 3. Early residents fortified the ship, converted its spaces into living quarters, and established the first stable government in the Capital Wasteland.

### Scientific Community

Rivet City became home to the wasteland's scientific elite. The establishment of the Science Lab attracted researchers who would eventually work on Project Purity.
