## Overview

**Hoover Dam** is a massive pre-war hydroelectric dam on the Colorado River, representing the most valuable strategic asset in the Mojave Wasteland. Control of the dam—and its power generation—is the primary objective of both the New California Republic and Caesar's Legion.

## Strategic Importance

### Power Generation

Hoover Dam is the only functional large-scale power generation facility in the region. Its turbines produce enough electricity to power:
- The entire city of New Vegas
- NCR territories to the west
- Potential expansion throughout the Mojave

### Water Control

The dam controls the flow of the Colorado River, making it crucial for:
- Agricultural irrigation
- Fresh water supply
- Regional development

### Military Significance

Whoever holds the dam controls the region's most vital resource. This makes it the ultimate prize in the conflict between the NCR and Legion.

## History

### Pre-War

Hoover Dam was completed in 1936 as a massive public works project. It provided power and water to Las Vegas and the surrounding region for over a century before the Great War.

### Survival

Unlike most infrastructure, Hoover Dam survived the Great War largely intact. Its location in a remote canyon and its robust construction protected it from direct nuclear strikes.

### Rediscovery

Mr. House, using his Securitrons, maintained awareness of the dam and planned to use it as leverage. The NCR eventually expanded far enough to discover and claim the dam.

### First Battle of Hoover Dam (2277)

Caesar's Legion launched an assault across the dam in 2277. The NCR, led by Chief Hanlon of the Rangers, lured the Legion into Boulder City and detonated explosives, destroying much of the Legion force. This defeat halted the Legion's advance.

## The Second Battle

The game's climax centers on the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, with four possible outcomes:

### NCR Victory (Eureka!)
The NCR defeats the Legion and maintains control of the dam, securing power for the Republic.

### Legion Victory (Veni, Vidi, Vici)
Caesar's Legion conquers the dam, giving them control of the Mojave and resources to push west.

### Mr. House Victory (All or Nothing)
Mr. House uses his upgraded Securitron army to take the dam, establishing independent control of New Vegas.

### Independent Vegas (No Gods, No Masters)
The Courier, using Yes Man, takes the dam for an independent New Vegas free from all major factions.

- **General Lee Oliver** - Overall NCR commander

### Legion Forces
- **Legate Lanius** - Legion field commander
- **Caesar** - Legion leader (commands from Fortification Hill)

## The Dam's Power

The dam's generators require specific components to function at full capacity:

### Securitron Upgrade
Mr. House has hidden a bunker beneath the dam containing a massive Securitron army and upgrade systems. Activating this bunker is crucial for House or Independent endings.

### Power Transmission
Power from the dam flows through transmission lines to New Vegas. Mr. House's treaty with the NCR grants them dam power in exchange for Vegas's independence.

## NCR Presence

The NCR has heavily fortified the dam:
- Multiple checkpoints
- Anti-aircraft guns
- Troop deployments
- Command infrastructure

## Defensive Challenges

The dam presents unique military challenges:
- **Narrow approaches** - Limited assault routes
- **Exposed positions** - Little cover on the dam itself
- **Water hazard** - The reservoir on one side, canyon on the other
- **Critical infrastructure** - Damage could affect power generation

## Legacy

Hoover Dam symbolizes:
- Pre-war American engineering achievement
- The value of infrastructure in rebuilding
- The high stakes of faction conflict
- The Mojave's uncertain future
