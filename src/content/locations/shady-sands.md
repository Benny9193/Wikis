## Overview

**Shady Sands** is a settlement in the wastes of California that grew from humble beginnings into the capital of the New California Republic. It represents one of the most successful examples of post-war civilization building in the Fallout universe.

## History

### Vault 15 Origins

Shady Sands was founded by dwellers from Vault 15. When their vault's resources became strained, some residents left to build a new life on the surface. They established Shady Sands as an agricultural community.

### Early Struggles

The fledgling community faced numerous challenges:
- Radscorpion infestations
- Raider attacks (particularly the Khans)
- Limited resources

In 2161, the Vault Dweller from Vault 13 arrived in Shady Sands. They helped the community by:
- Eliminating the radscorpion threat
- Rescuing Tandi from the Khans
- Teaching valuable survival skills
- Forging connections with other settlements

### Founding the NCR

Under the leadership of Aradesh and later his daughter Tandi, Shady Sands grew and formed alliances with neighboring communities. In 2189, these settlements united to form the New California Republic, with Shady Sands as its capital.
