## Overview

**Megaton** is a fortified settlement in the Capital Wasteland, built in and around a crater containing an undetonated atomic bomb. It is one of the first major locations encountered in Fallout 3 and serves as a primary hub for the early game.

## History

### Origins

Megaton was founded by survivors who sought shelter in the crater created by the bomb's impact. Over time, they scavenged aircraft parts and scrap metal from a nearby airport to build walls and structures.

### The Bomb

The settlement gets its name from the megaton-class atomic bomb sitting in the center of town. A religious group called the Church of the Children of Atom worships the bomb, believing it contains their god's power.
