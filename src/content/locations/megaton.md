## Overview

**Megaton** is a fortified settlement in the Capital Wasteland, built in the crater of an undetonated atomic bomb. It is one of the first major locations encountered in Fallout 3 and represents one of the most successful communities in the wasteland.

## History

### Origins

After the Great War, survivors discovered an undetonated nuclear bomb in a small crater. Rather than flee, they saw opportunity—the crater provided natural protection, and aircraft debris from a nearby crash site offered building materials.

### Construction

The settlers constructed walls from old aircraft parts, creating a distinctive curved aesthetic. The settlement grew organically around the central crater, with buildings stacked on multiple levels connected by ramps and walkways.

### The Church of Atom

A religious cult formed around the unexploded bomb, worshipping it as a divine artifact. The Church of Atom, led by Confessor Cromwell, believes radiation to be a sacred blessing from their deity, Atom.

## The Power of the Atom

The central moral choice of Megaton involves the atomic bomb:

### Disarm the Bomb
Working with Sheriff Simms, the player can disarm the bomb, making the settlement safe and earning the residents' gratitude—and a home in Megaton.

### Detonate the Bomb
Mr. Burke, an agent of Allistair Tenpenny, offers payment to install a fusion pulse charge and destroy the settlement. This results in Megaton's complete annihilation, observable from Tenpenny Tower.

## Economy

Megaton survives through:
- **Trade** - Craterside Supply serves as a major trading post
- **Water** - Purified water production
- **Services** - Saloon, clinic, and repairs
- **Protection** - Safe haven attracts travelers
