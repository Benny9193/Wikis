## Overview

**Vault 101** is a Vault-Tec vault located beneath the ruins of a small town in the Capital Wasteland, northwest of Megaton. It serves as the starting location for Fallout 3 and the childhood home of the Lone Wanderer.

## Vault Experiment

Vault 101's experiment was designed to test the effects of prolonged isolation. The vault was never meant to open, with its inhabitants kept in complete isolation from the outside world indefinitely. The Overseer was given absolute authority to maintain this isolation at any cost.

### "Nobody ever enters, and nobody ever leaves."

This motto, repeated throughout the vault, encapsulates the experiment's core principle. Residents were taught that the outside world was completely uninhabitable and that the vault was humanity's only sanctuary.

## History

### Construction and Sealing

Vault 101 was constructed before the Great War as part of Vault-Tec's network of fallout shelters. When the bombs fell on October 23, 2077, the vault sealed its doors with its assigned population inside.

### Life in the Vault

For over 200 years, Vault 101 maintained its isolation. Generations lived and died within its metal walls, developing their own culture and traditions. The vault's population remained stable through strict population control measures.

### The Overseer's Authority

The Overseer held absolute power within the vault, a position passed down through the Almodovar family. Alphonse Almodovar served as Overseer during the events of Fallout 3, maintaining strict adherence to the vault's isolation protocols.

## The Tunnel Snakes

A small gang of vault youths led by Butch DeLoria. Despite their tough image, they're relatively harmless troublemakers who serve as minor antagonists during the Lone Wanderer's childhood.

## Breaking Isolation

The vault's isolation ended when James arrived from outside with his infant child (the Lone Wanderer). Years later, James's departure forced open the question of the outside world, eventually leading to the Lone Wanderer's escape and the vault's first real contact with the wasteland in centuries.

## Return to Vault 101

The Lone Wanderer can return to Vault 101 during the "Trouble on the Homefront" quest, finding the vault in crisis. The resolution determines whether the vault opens to the outside world or remains sealed forever.
