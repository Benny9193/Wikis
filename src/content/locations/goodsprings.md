## Overview

**Goodsprings** is a small, struggling frontier community in the Mojave Wasteland. It serves as the starting location for Fallout: New Vegas, where the Courier recovers after being shot and left for dead.

## History

### Pre-War

Goodsprings was a small mining town before the Great War. The town survived relatively intact due to its remote location, away from major nuclear targets.

### Post-War

The community persisted through the centuries, maintaining a quiet existence as a waystation for travelers. The town's spring provides precious water in the desert environment.

## The Courier's Recovery

The Courier was rescued from a shallow grave at the Goodsprings Cemetery by Victor, a mysterious Securitron. Doc Mitchell, the town's physician, nursed the Courier back to health, removing the bullet from their head and providing initial equipment.

### Character Creation

The Courier's physical appearance, name, and initial SPECIAL stats are determined during the medical examination with Doc Mitchell. He also administers psychological tests that influence starting skills.

## Notable Residents

### Key NPCs
- **Doc Mitchell** - Town doctor who saves the Courier
- **Sunny Smiles** - Local hunter and militia trainer
- **Trudy** - Prospector Saloon owner
- **Chet** - General store owner
- **Easy Pete** - Retired prospector with explosives expertise
- **Victor** - Securitron who rescued the Courier

### Minor Residents
- **Joe Cobb** - Powder Ganger demanding tribute (hostile)
- **Cheyenne** - Sunny's dog
- **Pete** - Trudy's bodyguard (if helped)

## Locations

### Prospector Saloon
The social hub of Goodsprings, run by Trudy. The saloon serves food and drinks and is where the town's conflicts often play out.

### Doc Mitchell's House
A pre-war home converted into a medical clinic. Contains medical supplies and the Courier's starting equipment.

### Goodsprings General Store
Run by Chet, offering basic supplies, weapons, and ammunition. Chet is notably unhelpful during the town's crisis.

### Goodsprings Schoolhouse
An abandoned schoolhouse that serves as a tutorial area for lockpicking and contains minor loot.

### Goodsprings Cemetery
Where the Courier was buried by Benny. Victor's shack overlooks the graveyard.

### Goodsprings Source
A small spring that provides the town's water supply.

## Powder Ganger Conflict

Shortly after recovery, the Courier witnesses a confrontation between the townspeople and the Powder Gangers, escaped convicts from the NCR Correctional Facility.

### Ghost Town Gunfight
The Courier can help the town defend against Joe Cobb and the Powder Gangers by:
- Recruiting townspeople (Sunny, Trudy, Chet, Easy Pete, Doc Mitchell)
- Gathering supplies (leather armor, dynamite)
- Directly fighting the Powder Gangers

### Run Goodsprings Run
Alternatively, the Courier can side with the Powder Gangers, helping them take over the town. This results in most residents being killed.

## Tutorial Functions

Goodsprings serves as an extended tutorial for New Vegas:
- **Combat** - Sunny Smiles teaches shooting
- **Survival** - Gecko hunting and campfire cooking
- **Medicine** - Doc Mitchell's explanations
- **Reputation** - Introduction to faction relationships
- **Speech/Barter** - Various skill check opportunities

## Economy

Goodsprings survives through:
- Water from the natural spring
- Gecko hunting
- Trading with travelers
- Prospecting in nearby areas

## Strategic Importance

Despite its small size, Goodsprings sits on the main road from the southern Mojave to New Vegas. This makes it a natural waystation but also a target for groups like the Powder Gangers seeking to control the route.

## Post-Quest Status

The town's fate depends on player choices:
- **Town survives**: Residents remain, grateful for help
- **Town falls**: Powder Gangers occupy, most NPCs die
- **Neutral**: Town persists but relationships may vary
