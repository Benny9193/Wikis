## Overview

**The Strip** is the heart of New Vegas, a brightly lit oasis of pre-war decadence in the Mojave Wasteland. Controlled by the enigmatic Mr. House, the Strip represents the closest thing to civilization and luxury in the post-apocalyptic world.

## History

Before the Great War, Las Vegas was a world-famous destination for gambling and entertainment. When the bombs fell, Mr. House used his vast resources and Securitron army to protect the city, shooting down most of the nuclear warheads targeting the area.

After the war, Mr. House spent decades in hibernation while his systems worked to restore power and rebuild. When he finally awoke, he set about rebuilding the Strip with the help of local tribes he recruited and transformed into the casino families.

## Layout

The Strip is divided into several sections, separated by gates:

### South Strip

- **Gomorrah** - Run by the Omertas, known for its adult entertainment
- **Lucky 38** - Mr. House's personal casino and headquarters

### Central Strip

- **The Tops** - Run by the Chairmen, classic Vegas style
- **Ultra-Luxe** - Run by the White Glove Society, high-class establishment

### North Strip

- **Vault 21** - A converted vault now serving as a hotel
- **The Strip North Gate** - Entrance to Freeside

## Access

Entry to the Strip requires either:

- A passport (purchasable for 2,000 caps)
- Credit check (2,000+ caps on person)
- Science skill check (80) on the Securitron
- NCR/Legion fame
- Completing certain quests

## The Three Families

Mr. House recruited three local tribes to run his casinos:

1. **The Chairmen** (The Tops) - Cool, rat-pack style operators
2. **The Omertas** (Gomorrah) - Seedy underworld figures
3. **The White Glove Society** (Ultra-Luxe) - Refined aristocrats with dark secrets

## Securitrons

The Strip is patrolled by Securitrons, Mr. House's robot army. These Mark I units maintain order and protect Mr. House's interests.
