## Overview

The **New California Republic (NCR)** is a democratic federation of settlements in post-war California. It represents one of the most successful attempts at rebuilding civilization after the Great War, with a functional government, economy, and military.

## History

### Foundation

The NCR was founded in 2189 by the inhabitants of Shady Sands, a settlement that grew from one of the original Vaults. Aradesh, the first president, established the principles of democracy and expansion that would define the Republic.

### Expansion

Under successive presidents, the NCR grew to encompass most of California, absorbing settlements through diplomacy, economics, and occasionally force. By 2281, the NCR boasts a population of over 700,000 citizens.

## Government

The NCR operates as a representative democracy:

- **President** - Elected head of state and government
- **Congress** - Legislative body with senators from each state
- **Rangers** - Elite paramilitary force
- **NCR Army** - Standing military force

## The Mojave Campaign

The NCR's expansion into the Mojave Wasteland brings them into conflict with Caesar's Legion. Key NCR locations in the Mojave include:

- **Hoover Dam** - Primary strategic objective
- **Camp McCarran** - Main military base
- **Camp Golf** - Ranger training facility
- **The Strip** - Treaty with Mr. House

## Military

### NCR Army

The regular military force, equipped with standard firearms, combat armor, and organized into squads, platoons, and battalions.

### NCR Rangers

Elite soldiers who serve as scouts, special forces, and peacekeepers. Veteran Rangers wear distinctive black armor and are among the deadliest fighters in the wasteland.

## Economy

The NCR has a functioning economy based on:

- **NCR Dollars** - Paper currency (though devalued)
- **Brahmin ranching** - Major agricultural industry
- **Trading** - Extensive trade networks
- **Taxes** - Government-funded infrastructure

## Criticisms

- Bureaucratic inefficiency
