## Overview

The **Brotherhood of Steel** is a quasi-religious military organization that originated from the remnants of the United States Armed Forces. Founded after the Great War, the Brotherhood is dedicated to preserving pre-war technology and preventing it from falling into the wrong hands.

## History

### Origins

The Brotherhood was founded by Captain Roger Maxson at the Mariposa Military Base in California. After discovering the horrific FEV experiments being conducted there, Maxson and his troops rebelled against the U.S. government. Following the Great War, they established themselves at Lost Hills bunker.

### Core Beliefs

- Technology must be preserved and protected
- Advanced technology in the wrong hands leads to destruction
- The Brotherhood has a duty to collect and safeguard technology

## Chapters

### West Coast Brotherhood

The original chapter, based at Lost Hills in California. They tend to be more isolationist and traditional in their interpretation of the Brotherhood's mission.

### East Coast Brotherhood

Led by Elder Lyons and later Elder Maxson, the East Coast chapter has undergone significant changes. Under Lyons, they focused on protecting wasteland inhabitants, which was controversial among traditionalists.

### Mojave Chapter

A small, weakened chapter operating from Hidden Valley in the Mojave Wasteland. They maintain strict isolation protocols due to their conflict with the NCR.

## Technology

The Brotherhood is known for their advanced technology, including:

- **Power Armor** - T-60 and T-51 series power armor
