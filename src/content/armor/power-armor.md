## Overview

**Power Armor** represents the pinnacle of pre-war military technology. These powered exoskeletons provide incredible protection against ballistic, energy, and radiation damage while dramatically enhancing the wearer's strength and carrying capacity.

## History

### Development

Power Armor was developed by West Tek and the United States military before the Great War as infantry-mounted tank technology. The project went through several iterations:

- **T-45** - First mass-produced model
- **T-51** - Improved design, iconic model
- **T-60** - Last pre-war model, standard U.S. Army issue
- **X-01** - Experimental advanced model

### Post-War

After the Great War, Power Armor became rare and valuable. The Brotherhood of Steel made collecting and maintaining Power Armor a central focus of their organization.
