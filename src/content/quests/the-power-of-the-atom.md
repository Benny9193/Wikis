## Overview

**The Power of the Atom** is one of the first major quests encountered in Fallout 3 and presents one of gaming's most memorable moral choices: disarm the atomic bomb in the center of Megaton, or detonate it for a wealthy benefactor.

## Quest Start

The quest can be initiated in two ways:

### Lucas Simms
Speaking with Sheriff Lucas Simms about the bomb will prompt him to ask for help disarming it. He offers a reward of caps based on your Speech skill.

### Mister Burke
A mysterious man in Moriarty's Saloon will approach the player with an offer to destroy Megaton on behalf of Allistair Tenpenny, who finds the town an eyesore from his tower.

## The Choice

**Requirements:**
- Explosives skill of 25 or higher

**Rewards:**
- Your own house in Megaton
- 100-500 caps from Simms (based on Speech)
- Good karma
- Access to Megaton's services permanently

**Consequences:**
- Megaton remains intact
- Mister Burke may attempt to kill Simms if reported
- Positive reputation with Megaton residents

### Option 2: Detonate the Bomb

**Requirements:**
- Accept Burke's fusion pulse charge
- Arm the bomb
- Travel to Tenpenny Tower
