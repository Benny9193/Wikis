## Overview

**Ring-a-Ding-Ding!** is a pivotal main quest in Fallout: New Vegas. After tracking Benny across the Mojave, the Courier finally confronts the man who shot them in the head and left them for dead in the Goodsprings cemetery.

## Quest Objectives

1. Enter the Strip
2. Go to The Tops casino
3. Confront Benny
4. Recover the Platinum Chip

## Background

### The Setup
Benny, chairman of The Tops casino, intercepted the Courier and stole the Platinum Chip—a valuable item being delivered to Mr. House. He shot the Courier and buried them in Goodsprings Cemetery, but the Courier survived thanks to Victor and Doc Mitchell.

### The Chase
Through "Ain't That a Kick in the Head" and "They Went That-a-Way," the Courier tracked Benny's path from Goodsprings through Primm, Nipton, Novac, Boulder City, and finally to the Strip.

## Entering the Strip

### Credit Check
The Strip requires 2,000 caps or a passport:
- Science check on the Securitron
- Bribe the gate guard
- Obtain a passport (King's Gambit quest)
- Have enough caps on hand

### The Tops Security
Upon entering The Tops:
- All weapons are confiscated
- Holdout weapons can be smuggled in
- Sneak skill determines what you can keep
- Black Widow perk allows special approach

## Confronting Benny

Multiple approaches exist:

### Direct Confrontation
- Speak with Benny in the casino
- He attempts to talk his way out
- Can attack him directly
- His bodyguards will defend him

### Stealth Approach
- Sneak to his suite (13th floor)
- Access through maintenance areas
- Catch him unprepared
- Avoid casino security

### Black Widow/Confirmed Bachelor
- Seduce Benny (female Courier)
- Invite him to his suite
- Kill him in his sleep
- Easiest and most ironic approach

### Let Him Go
- Accept his explanations
- Allow him to leave
- He escapes to The Fort
- Confrontation delayed to later

## Benny's Suite

Regardless of approach, search his suite:
- Find Yes Man (disabled Securitron)
- Discover Benny's plans
- Learn about the Platinum Chip
- Opens Independent Vegas path

## Yes Man

A crucial discovery in Benny's suite:
- Reprogrammed Securitron
- Cannot refuse requests
- Explains Benny's plan
- Offers alternative to all factions

## The Platinum Chip

Recovery of the chip allows:
- Delivery to Mr. House
- Use for independent Vegas
- Give to NCR or Legion
- Opens all endgame paths

## Aftermath

### If Benny Killed
- The Tops continues operating
- His bodyguards become neutral
- Maria (his gun) can be looted
- Quest completes normally

### If Benny Escaped
- He flees to Caesar's Legion
- "Render Unto Caesar" continues pursuit
- Can be killed at The Fort
- The chip must still be recovered
