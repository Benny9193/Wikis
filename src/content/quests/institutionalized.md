## Overview

**Institutionalized** is the pivotal quest in Fallout 4 where the Sole Survivor finally reaches the Institute. After building a teleporter with faction assistance, the player discovers the shocking truth about their son Shaun and the Institute's nature.

## Quest Objectives

1. Use the signal interceptor
2. Explore the Institute
3. Meet Father
4. Make a decision about the Institute

## Background

### The Search for Shaun
The entire game leads to this moment:
- Shaun kidnapped from Vault 111
- Kellogg killed (or discovered)
- Memory Den reveals Institute location
- Teleporter built with faction help

### The Molecular Level
Prerequisite quest requires:
- Courser chip from a Courser
- Teleporter schematics from Virgil
- Construction help from a faction
- Power source to activate

## Teleportation

### Using the Interceptor
When activated:
- Step onto the platform
- Dramatic teleportation sequence
- Arrival inside the Institute
- Relay room location

### First Impressions
The Institute is unlike the wasteland:
- Clean, pristine corridors
- Advanced technology everywhere
- Synths and scientists working
- Completely self-contained

## Exploring the Institute

### Initial Freedom
Upon arrival:
- Free to explore (mostly)
- Scientists react neutrally
- Synths ignore the player
- Some areas restricted

### Facility Layout
The Institute contains:
- Atrium (central hub)
- BioScience division
- Robotics division
- Advanced Systems
- Synth Retention Bureau
- Father's quarters

## Meeting Father

### The Revelation
In Father's quarters:
- A child Synth appears first
- Speaks as if he's Shaun
- Revealed to be a test
- Father enters

### The Truth About Shaun
The devastating reveal:
- Father IS Shaun—now an old man
- 60+ years passed for him
- You were only frozen 10 years ago (for him)
- He's the Director of the Institute

### Shaun's Story
Father explains:
- He was raised by the Institute
- Became a scientist, then Director
- He released you from cryo
- Kellogg's raid was 60 years ago
- He's now dying of cancer

## The Choice

Father offers a choice:
- Join the Institute
- Work with them as family
- Or leave and oppose them

### Joining
- Begins Institute questline
- Access to Institute resources
- "Mankind Redefined" quest starts
- Other faction options close (eventually)

### Leaving
- Can still leave peacefully
- Return to other factions
- Institute becomes hostile (later)
- Father shows disappointment

## Immediate Aftermath

Regardless of choice:
- Teleportation access granted
- Fast travel to Institute available
- Father's quarters accessible
- Institute quests become available

## Implications

This quest raises questions:
- Is Father truly your son?
- Can you trust the Institute?
- What happened during those 60 years?
- Why did Father release you?

### Father's Motivations
Possible interpretations:
- Genuine desire for family
- Experiment in human behavior
- Need for outside perspective
- Successor grooming

## Synth Shaun

The child Synth is significant:
- Created to father's childhood memories
- May survive the ending
- Companion possibility in some endings
- Represents what Shaun might have been
