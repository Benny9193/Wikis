## Walkthrough

### Leaving the Vault

After completing "Escape!" the player emerges from Vault 101 into the wasteland. The quest automatically begins, pointing toward Megaton as the first destination.

### Megaton

The fortified town of Megaton is the natural first stop. Multiple NPCs can provide information:

#### Colin Moriarty
The saloon owner knows James passed through:
- Can pay for information (100 caps)
- Can hack his terminal
- Can use Speech to get info free
- Reveals James went to Galaxy News Radio

#### Other Sources
- Various residents mention seeing a vault dweller
- Some point toward GNR Plaza

### Galaxy News Radio

The player must travel to GNR Plaza in the D.C. ruins:

#### The Journey
- Navigate through D.C. Metro tunnels
- Emerge near the Mall
- Fight through Super Mutant territory

#### The Battle
Upon approaching GNR:
- Brotherhood of Steel soldiers fighting Super Mutants
- A Super Mutant Behemoth attacks
- Fat Man found nearby for the fight
- Help the Brotherhood survive

### Meeting Three Dog

After the battle, enter the GNR building:
- Three Dog is the DJ of Galaxy News Radio
- He knows James was heading to Rivet City
- May ask for a favor before revealing information
- Can skip his quest with high Speech

## Three Dog's Request

Three Dog asks the player to retrieve a satellite dish from the Museum of Technology:

### Galaxy News Radio (Quest)
- Optional quest to help GNR
- Rewards with better information
- Three Dog speaks more favorably of you on air

### Skipping the Quest
- High Speech check bypasses the task
- Three Dog reluctantly gives information
- GNR signal remains weaker

## Completion

The quest completes when you learn James went to Rivet City, beginning the next main quest: **Scientific Pursuits**

## Key Characters
