## Overview

**Feral Ghouls** are humans who have been exposed to massive amounts of radiation and have subsequently lost their mental faculties. Unlike sentient ghouls who retain their humanity, ferals have devolved into aggressive, mindless creatures driven by base instincts.

## Origins

### Ghoulification

When humans are exposed to high levels of radiation, some undergo ghoulification rather than dying. This process:
- Dramatically extends lifespan
- Causes severe skin decay and hair loss
- May preserve mental faculties (non-feral) or destroy them (feral)

### Going Feral

The transition to a feral state is not fully understood. Contributing factors may include:
- Extreme radiation exposure
- Prolonged isolation
- Brain damage from radiation
- Time (some ghouls eventually go feral after centuries)

## Behavior

### Hunting Patterns
- Often found in dark, irradiated areas
- May appear dormant until disturbed
- Hunt by sound and movement
- Attack relentlessly once aware of prey

### Pack Mentality
- Frequently found in groups
- Attracted to other ferals
- Some appear to follow Glowing Ones

## Variants

### Standard Tiers
- **Feral Ghoul** - Base variant
- **Feral Ghoul Roamer** - Slightly stronger
- **Feral Ghoul Stalker** - More aggressive
- **Feral Ghoul Reaver** - High-level, throws radioactive gore

### Special Variants
- **Glowing One** - Heavily irradiated, emits radiation, can revive dead ferals
- **Charred Feral Ghoul** (Fallout 4) - Fire-resistant, high damage
- **Bloated Glowing One** - Massive radiation aura

### Fallout 76 Variants
- **Scorched Feral Ghoul** - Infected with Scorched Plague
- **Wendigo** - Related mutant creature

## Combat

### Threat Level
Medium to High (varies by variant)

### Attack Patterns
- Fast, lunging melee attacks
- Reavers throw radioactive projectiles
- Glowing Ones emit radiation bursts
- Often attack in waves

### Weaknesses
- Headshots (limb damage system)
- Fire damage
- Limited intelligence
- No ranged attacks (except Reavers)

### Strategies
- Maintain distance when possible
- Target legs to slow movement
- Eliminate Glowing Ones first (they revive others)
- Use choke points

## Locations

Commonly found in:
- Pre-war hospitals and morgues
- Subway tunnels
- Irradiated areas
- Abandoned buildings
- Nuclear facilities

## Lore Implications

The existence of feral ghouls raises ethical questions explored in the games:
- When does a ghoul stop being human?
- Should ferals be considered victims or threats?
- Can going feral be prevented or reversed?

## Trivia

- Some non-feral ghouls fear eventually going feral
- The Underworld in Fallout 3 is a safe haven for non-ferals
- Hancock in Fallout 4 became a ghoul voluntarily
- Ferals ignore non-feral ghouls (sometimes)
