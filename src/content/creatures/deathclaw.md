## Overview

**Deathclaws** are mutated Jackson's chameleons that have become the apex predators of the post-apocalyptic wasteland. Standing up to 10 feet tall with razor-sharp claws and incredible speed, they are among the most feared creatures in the Fallout universe.

## Origins

Deathclaws were created before the Great War through genetic engineering at a secret U.S. government facility. The project aimed to create a replacement for human soldiers in close combat situations. When the bombs fell, the deathclaws escaped and thrived in the irradiated wasteland.

## Physical Characteristics

- **Height**: 9-10 feet when standing upright
- **Weight**: Approximately 800-1000 pounds
- **Claws**: 12-inch razor-sharp talons
- **Skin**: Thick, leathery hide resistant to small arms fire
- **Speed**: Can reach speeds of 25+ mph

## Behavior

### Territorial

Deathclaws are highly territorial and will attack anything that enters their domain. They often nest in caves, quarries, and abandoned structures.

### Pack Hunters

While often encountered alone, deathclaws can live in packs led by an alpha male and containing females and young. Deathclaw nests are extremely dangerous.

### Intelligence

Deathclaws demonstrate above-average intelligence for wasteland creatures. Some have been observed using basic tactics and even been domesticated under rare circumstances.

## Variants

### Standard Deathclaw

The common variety, deadly enough to threaten even experienced wastelanders.

### Alpha Deathclaw

Larger and more aggressive males that lead packs. Distinguished by their darker coloration and larger horns.

### Deathclaw Matriarch

Female leaders of nests, fiercely protective of their eggs and young.

### Legendary Deathclaw

Rare, exceptionally powerful individuals with enhanced abilities.

### Chameleon Deathclaw (Fallout 4)

A variant that can turn partially invisible, making them even more dangerous.

## Combat Strategies

- Use high-powered weapons (anti-materiel rifles, missile launchers)
- Target the legs to slow their charge
- Maintain distance—their melee attacks are devastating
- Use terrain to your advantage
- Power Armor provides significant protection

## Notable Locations

- **Quarry Junction** (New Vegas) - Infested with numerous deathclaws
- **Deathclaw Sanctuary** (Fallout 3) - A cave filled with deathclaws
- **Museum of Witchcraft** (Fallout 4) - Contains a Deathclaw and egg
