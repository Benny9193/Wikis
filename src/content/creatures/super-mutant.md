## Overview

**Super Mutants** are humans who have been exposed to the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV), resulting in dramatic physical and mental changes. While most are hostile, some retain their intelligence and even become allies to humans.

## Origins

### The Forced Evolutionary Virus

FEV was developed before the Great War by West Tek as a biological weapon. It was designed to create super soldiers but had unpredictable results when applied to humans.

### Different Strains

Super Mutants vary by region due to different FEV strains:

#### West Coast (Fallout 1 & 2)
- Created by the Master at Mariposa Military Base
- Generally more intelligent
- Led by the Unity, seeking to convert all humans

#### East Coast (Fallout 3 & 4)
- Created at Vault 87 (Capital Wasteland)
- Created at the Institute (Commonwealth)
- Often less intelligent and more aggressive
- No unified leadership

#### Appalachia (Fallout 76)
- Created at West Tek Research Center
- Pre-war experiments gone wrong

## Physical Characteristics

- Height: 7-10+ feet (Behemoths much larger)
- Green or yellow skin
- Dramatically increased muscle mass
- Enhanced strength and durability
- Sterile (cannot reproduce naturally)
- Immunity to disease and radiation
- Extended lifespan

## Intelligence

Intelligence varies significantly:
- Some retain human-level intellect (Marcus, Fawkes, Strong)
- Many have reduced cognitive function
- Some are barely sentient

## Society

### West Coast
The Master created an organized society with goals of "unity" through forced conversion.

### East Coast
Generally tribal, with:
- Camps in urban ruins
- Gore bags and mutilated corpses as decoration
- Capture of humans for conversion or food
- "Super Mutant Behemoths" as leaders

## Variants

### Standard Tiers
- **Super Mutant** - Base variant
- **Super Mutant Brute** - Stronger, more health
- **Super Mutant Master** - Intelligent, tactical
- **Super Mutant Overlord** (Fallout 3) - Highest tier

### Special Variants
- **Behemoth** - Massive variants, mini-boss level threats
- **Suicider** (Fallout 4) - Carries mini-nuke, charges enemies
- **Nightkin** (New Vegas) - Stealth-capable, use Stealth Boys

## Combat

### Threat Level
Medium to Very High (varies by variant)

### Weapons Used
- Pipe weapons and hunting rifles (low tier)
- Assault rifles and super sledges (mid tier)
- Miniguns and missile launchers (high tier)
- Mini-nukes (Suiciders)

### Tactics
- Target Suiciders' mini-nukes to detonate them
- Use cover against ranged attacks
- Focus fire on Behemoths
- Watch for flanking attempts

## Notable Super Mutants

- **The Master** (Fallout 1) - Creator of West Coast mutants
- **Marcus** (Fallout 2, New Vegas) - Friendly sheriff of Jacobstown
- **Fawkes** (Fallout 3) - Intelligent, potential companion
- **Strong** (Fallout 4) - Companion seeking "milk of human kindness"
- **Lily Bowen** (New Vegas) - Nightkin companion, former grandmother

## Trivia

- The dipping process in FEV vats is fatal to about 50% of subjects
- Nightkin addiction to Stealth Boys causes schizophrenia
- Super Mutants call humans "meatbags" or "little ones"
- Some Super Mutants remember their human lives
