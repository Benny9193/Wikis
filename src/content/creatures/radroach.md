## Overview

**Radroaches** are giant mutated cockroaches that have grown to alarming sizes due to radiation exposure. They are one of the most common creatures in the wasteland and often the first enemies encountered by vault dwellers venturing outside.

## Biology

### Mutation

Pre-war cockroaches were already remarkably resilient creatures. Exposure to radiation from the Great War caused them to grow significantly larger while retaining their survivability traits.

### Characteristics
- Size: 1-2 feet in length
- Hard exoskeleton provides some protection
- Fast movement speed
- Reproduce rapidly
- Nocturnal preferences
- Can survive extreme conditions

## Behavior

Radroaches are opportunistic scavengers that:
- Infest abandoned buildings and caves
- Attack in swarms when threatened
- Flee from superior opponents (sometimes)
- Feed on organic matter, including corpses

## Variants

### Standard Radroach
The most common variety, found everywhere in the wasteland.

### Giant Radroach
Larger specimens with more health and damage.

### Glowing Radroach
Irradiated variants that deal radiation damage and glow green. Often found near nuclear material.

### Radroach Nymph
Juvenile radroaches, smaller and weaker than adults.

## Combat

### Threat Level
Low - Radroaches are among the weakest enemies and serve as early-game threats.

### Tactics
- Swarm in groups
- Quick, erratic movement
- Bite attacks

### Counter-Strategies
- Any weapon is effective
- Stomp attacks in melee
- Area-of-effect weapons for groups
- VATS targeting for easy kills

## Locations

Commonly found in:
- Vaults (often the first enemies encountered)
- Abandoned buildings
- Subway tunnels
- Caves and mines
- Sewers
- Basements

## Uses

### Food
Radroach meat can be cooked and consumed, providing minor health restoration. Not particularly appetizing but widely available.

### Crafting (Fallout 4/76)
Radroach meat is used in various cooking recipes and can be a component in certain crafting projects.

## Trivia

- Based on the real-life American cockroach
- Often used as tutorial enemies
- Vault 101 in Fallout 3 has a radroach infestation
- Some wastelanders keep them as pets
- More nutritious than one might expect
