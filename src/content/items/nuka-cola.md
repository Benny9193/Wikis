## Overview

**Nuka-Cola** is the most popular soft drink in the Fallout universe, having been the dominant beverage in America before the Great War. Even 200 years after the apocalypse, Nuka-Cola remains highly sought after for its refreshing taste and restorative properties.

## History

### Pre-War

Nuka-Cola was invented in 2044 by John-Caleb Bradberton. Through aggressive marketing and a secret formula, Nuka-Cola Corporation grew to become one of the largest companies in America. By 2077, Nuka-Cola had a near-monopoly on the soft drink market.

### Secret Ingredient

The original Nuka-Cola formula contained a mildly radioactive isotope that gave it a unique flavor and addictive quality. This isotope also contributed to the drink's remarkable preservation over centuries.

## Variants

### Classic Varieties

- **Nuka-Cola** - The original formula
- **Nuka-Cola Quantum** - Glowing blue variant with extra kick
- **Nuka-Cherry** - Cherry-flavored variant
- **Nuka-Cola Victory** - Citrus variant

### Regional Varieties (Nuka-World)

- **Nuka-Grape** - Grape flavored
- **Nuka-Orange** - Orange flavored
- **Nuka-Wild** - Western themed
- **Nuka-Love** - Limited edition

### Mixed Drinks (Fallout 4)

Players can create mixed Nuka-Cola drinks at mixing stations:

- **Nuka-Sunrise**
- **Nuka-Cooler**
- **Nuka-Bombdrop**

## Nuka-Cola Corporation

The Nuka-Cola Corporation was a massive pre-war conglomerate that expanded beyond soft drinks into:

- Nuka-World theme park
- Nuka-Cola branded merchandise
- Various subsidiaries

## Collectibles

### Nuka-Cola Bottles

Empty bottles can be used as crafting materials or returned for caps at certain vendors.

### Bottle Caps

Nuka-Cola bottle caps became the standard currency of the wasteland, as they were difficult to counterfeit and existed in limited quantities.

## Cultural Impact

Nuka-Cola has become a symbol of pre-war America in the wasteland. Collectors prize vintage Nuka-Cola memorabilia, and the distinctive red and white branding is recognized throughout the wasteland.
