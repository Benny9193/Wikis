## Overview

**Bloody Mess** is one of the most iconic perks in the Fallout series, appearing in every mainline game. It provides a flat damage bonus while adding spectacular (and gruesome) death animations to defeated enemies.

## Effects

### Damage Bonus
- +5% damage with all weapons (per rank in later games)
- Applies to all damage types
- Stacks multiplicatively with other damage bonuses

### Gore Effects
- Enemies have a chance to explode upon death
- Gibs (body parts) scatter across the area
- Blood splatters on nearby surfaces
- Applies regardless of killing weapon

## Requirements by Game

### Fallout 1 & 2
- Available at character creation as a trait
- No stat requirements

### Fallout 3
- Level 6
- No SPECIAL requirements

### Fallout: New Vegas
- Level 6
- No SPECIAL requirements

### Fallout 4
- Luck 3
- Available at level 1
- 3 ranks available

### Fallout 76
- Luck-based perk card
- Multiple ranks available

## Ranks (Fallout 4)

| Rank | Requirement | Effect |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Luck 3 | +5% damage, enemies may explode |
| 2 | Level 9 | +10% damage |
| 3 | Level 31 | +15% damage |

## Strategic Value

### Pros
- Universal damage increase
- Works with all builds
- No weapon or skill restrictions
- Early availability

### Cons
- Exploding enemies may destroy loot
- Gore can obscure vision temporarily
- Some players find effects distasteful
- Body parts can be harder to loot

## Lore Implications

The perk description often humorously suggests that the character is just inherently violent or unlucky for their enemies:

> "With the Bloody Mess perk, characters and creatures you kill will often explode into a red, gut-filled, eyeball-strewn paste."

## Tips

- Excellent for any combat-focused build
- Take early for maximum benefit
- Pairs well with any weapon specialization
- Consider if you frequently loot bodies

## Trivia

- One of few perks appearing in all Fallout games
- The gore effects are entirely cosmetic beyond the perk's function
- Inspiration may come from over-the-top action films
- Death animations are randomized, not every kill explodes
- Some companions may comment on the carnage
