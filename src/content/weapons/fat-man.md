## Overview

The **Fat Man** is a shoulder-mounted tactical nuclear catapult, capable of launching mini-nukes at targets. It is one of the most devastating weapons available in the Fallout series, capable of destroying groups of enemies and even some of the toughest creatures in a single shot.

## History

The M-42 Fat Man was developed by the U.S. military before the Great War as a portable nuclear weapon system. Named after the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki, the Fat Man was designed to give infantry soldiers tactical nuclear capability.

## Mechanics

### Operation

The Fat Man uses a small catapult mechanism to launch mini-nukes in a high arc. The weapon has a relatively slow reload time and limited ammunition availability, making it best suited for dire situations.

### Blast Radius

The mini-nuke creates a large explosion that deals massive damage to everything in the blast radius. Users must be careful to maintain sufficient distance from the impact point to avoid self-inflicted damage.

## Variants

### Fallout 3

- **Fat Man** - Standard variant
- **Experimental MIRV** - Fires 8 mini-nukes simultaneously

### Fallout: New Vegas

- **Fat Man** - Standard variant
- **Esther** - Unique variant with higher damage

### Fallout 4

- **Fat Man** - Standard variant
- **Big Boy** - Unique variant that fires two mini-nukes for the cost of one
- **Nuka-Nuke Launcher** - Modified to fire Nuka-Nukes (Nuka-World DLC)

## Ammunition

Mini-nukes are rare and expensive, typically found in military installations, sold by specialized vendors, or occasionally dropped by legendary enemies.

## Tactical Use

The Fat Man excels against:

- Groups of enemies
- Heavily armored targets (Deathclaws, Sentry Bots)
- Fortified positions
- Boss encounters

## Warnings

- Never fire at close range
- Be aware of companions in the blast zone
- Mini-nukes are scarce—use wisely
