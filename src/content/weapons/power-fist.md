## Overview

The **Power Fist** is a pneumatically-powered striking weapon worn as a glove. It amplifies the user's punching power dramatically, making it one of the most effective unarmed weapons in the Fallout series.

## Mechanics

The Power Fist uses a pneumatic ram system to multiply the force of a punch. When the user's fist makes contact, the pneumatic mechanism fires, delivering a powerful blow that can shatter bones and dent metal.

## Versions by Game
