The **10mm Pistol** is perhaps the most iconic firearm in the Fallout series. It serves as the standard sidearm for Vault dwellers and is often one of the first weapons players acquire in their wasteland adventures.

## History

The 10mm Auto cartridge was adopted by the U.S. military as a replacement for the 9mm and .45 ACP rounds before the Great War. The N99 10mm pistol became the standard sidearm for military personnel and Vault-Tec security.
