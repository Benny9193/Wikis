## Overview

The **Laser Rifle** is a standard energy weapon used by various military and paramilitary organizations throughout the Fallout universe. It fires a concentrated beam of photons that can burn through armor and flesh alike.

## History

Laser weapons were developed before the Great War by various defense contractors. The AER9 laser rifle became the standard issue energy weapon for the U.S. military, though it never fully replaced conventional firearms due to cost and logistics.

## Mechanics

### How It Works

The laser rifle uses microfusion cells to power a concentrated beam of coherent light. The beam is focused through a series of lenses and mirrors before being projected toward the target.

### Advantages
- Negligible projectile travel time
- No bullet drop
- Ammunition is rechargeable with proper equipment
- Excellent accuracy

### Disadvantages
- Less effective against reflective surfaces
- Reduced performance in rain or fog
- Microfusion cells are heavy
- Less stopping power than comparable ballistic weapons

## Variants by Game

### Fallout 3 & New Vegas
- **Laser Rifle** - Standard AER9 model
- **Tri-Beam Laser Rifle** - Fires three beams simultaneously
- **Laser RCW** - Rapid-fire laser weapon

### Fallout 4
